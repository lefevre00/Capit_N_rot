Coding exercise

The app should ask the user for a string (in a form-field) and reject it if it doesn't start with a capital letter. If it is compliant, on the same screen, ask the user for an angle (0 ... 360 degrees).

With a "Next" button, jump to a new screen, show an image of your choice rotated by the amount entered on the previous screen. Allow the user to go back again and change the angle if desired.

We expect the app to have rudimentary tests.
